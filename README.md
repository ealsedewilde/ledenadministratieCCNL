# ledenadministratieCCNL
JAVA-FX application for membership administration of CitroÃ«n Club Nederland.

# Purpose of this application.
As a 'regular' Java-developer you normally don't come across Java-FX. 
But now that I'm retired I have time to look at this intriguing technology.
There are a lot of examples on the internet but mostly not beyond the HelloWorld level.
I wanted to explore Java-FX in a full size application, so with dozens of screens and menu choices. It also should interact with a real business layer.

Exploring a technology is easier when there is a well understood use-case. 
For me this membership administration is such a use-case. I already had some java code working on MS-Excel sheets.
The idea was to enhance this starting point to a real desktop application.

Aside of developing the application, I also wanted to look at an efficient deployment of the application, thus looking at JPMS.

# Design
## Spring Boot
I've designed quite some applications througout my career.
Over the years Spring Boot has been the natural starting point for structuring an application. After checking some websites it turned out that combining Spring Boot and Java-FX is quite easy. My Class `SpringJavaFXBase` contains the extendable base structure to accomplish the integration of Spring Boot and Java-FX.

```
@SpringBootApplication
public class MySpringBootApplication {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Application.launch(MyJavaFXApplication.class, args);
  }
}
```

```
public class MyJavaFXApplication extends SpringJavaFXBase {

  public JavaFXApplication() {
    super(MySpringBootApplication.class);
  }

}
```

Spring Boot has one big disadvantage: the startup takes some time. Starting the application in my IDE took about 9 seconds.
I've chosen for lazy `lazy-initialization`. This helps gaining a few seconds, since only a handful of components is needed to start the application.

## Database
I've made it easy on myself and have just chosen an embedded H2-database. Embedding the database also has the disadvantage that startup takes time. I've chosen `BootstrapMode.LAZY` to reduce the time to initialize SpringBoot JPA. Starting the application in my IDE was reduced to about 5 seconds.

The most challenging issue was a way to backup and restore the database while the application kept running. Backup is done via `SCRIPT SIMPLE NOPASSWORDS DROP TO '%s' COMPRESSION ZIP`. The restore is executing all the native sql statements of the backup one by one.

## Startup 
I initially have built this application as a single jar via the 'repackage' goal of the spring-boot-maven-plugin. (I changed that afterwards for a more efficient variant.)

As said before, the startup takes time, so the user needs to know that something is happening when starting the application. I have taken the easiest solution with a 'SplashScreen-Image' in the manifest of the application jar. 

## FXML
I've chosen for FXML because I had no experience of building screens. In such a situation the SceneBuilder is handy to roughly model the screens. I also had the idea that FXML somehow will give me a ModelViewController like solution. I now think that the View (FXML) is too closely coupled with the Java-FX controller to have a true MVC-paradigm. 

I need a mechanism to control the flow between the dozens of fxml files. I have defined the `PageName` enum that points to the fxml file that it refers to. I noticed that loading fxml is a quite heavy task, so once loaded I cache the fxml; in the `FXMLNodeMap`. Caching means that the initialization of controllers only happens once. When reusing a screen it has to be reset explicitly. (I'm used to it, but I'm not sure if it is the best option.) Later i came across the FxWeaver framework. I've looked at it, but found it not flexible enough to suit my needs, so I sticked to the mechanism I had.

## Controlling the UI.
Being able to identify a fxml pages via the PageName enum is a start, but not the whole story of controlling the UI.
My design is that my base screen (main.fxml) is a Vbox with the included menu.fxml and a BorderPane. In the TOP section of the BorderPane I show a generic header. The CENTER initially contains a placeholder fxml. Based on menu choices various dialogs of pages are loaded one by one in the CENTER of the BorderPane. The BOTTOM section is used for displaying messages. 

It is the `PageController` that handles the loading of pages and showing the correct page in the CENTER of the BorderPane of the main.fxml. The PageController also controls the display of confirmation/error messages in the BOTTOM section.

It is the `MenuController` that handles menu choices. 
The MenuController has to activate the applicable fx controller. This can be every controller in the application.
I use eventing to decouple the MenuController from all other controllers. I use Spring's `@EventListener` with a SPEL `condition` on the event to target the correct controller or command. Some events are grouped. Such an event is than first handled on a group event condition and after that forwarded to the correct detail event condition. For example a number of events require a selected Member. So the event group MEMBER-SEARCH triggers the Member search process and with the result of the search, the correct detail event is triggered. 

Besides fx controller related menu choices, there are some menu choices without a visual component. They are just commands to be executed.
The CENTER of the BorderPane has to show the placeholder fxml when such a command is choosen. The events related to commands contain a property `command = true;`. This is used in a `@EventListener` `condition` in the `PageController`. to load the placeholder fxml.

As said I use lazy loading of Spring components. The `@EventListener` eventing mechanism loads the Spring component when not yet loaded. 

The application uses **forms** that span multiple pages. (Registering all properties for a new member is a form that is spread across four pages.) All the pages of a form are linked to the `FormController` extension for the specific form. I use one generic form.fxml as a skeleton for all forms; When loading this generic form.fxml, the applicable `FormController` extension gets attached and FXML initialized. In this generic form.fxml the required form page fxml's are added/removed as needed. I use a generic basic mechanism for navigation between the pages of a form. This mechanism is extended for every specific form.

## Model View ViewMapping.
When using forms **data** has to be mapped between the **model** (JPA entities) and the **form** (Java-FX controls in the controller). I've built a generic extensible framework that can do this mapping (mainly) based on name equality of property names in both the **model** and the **form**; see the `ViewModel` class. I rely on Java bean introspection to determine the mapping. The ViewModel framework works quite well as long as the naming in model and controller is structured carefully. See my project https://github.com/ealsedewilde/javafx-viewmodel.
Via `nl.ealse.javafx.mapping.Mapping` annotations you can adjust the actual mapping as needed.

## Form validation
`javafx.beans.value.ChangeListener`s are added to the fields of a form that require validation. I have a number of standard implementations for the various types of validation. Such a validator produces an error message when the content of a form field is invalid. I have developed a framework to easily control the form validation. Notably a form can set a `java.util.function.Consumer<Boolean>` that enables/disables the save button of the form.
This framework has a `validate()` method that should be called on every switch to a new page of the form. It validates the complete form.
I have added a `FocusListener` that avoid an (annoying) error message on the field with focus, directly when switching to that form page.
Only when it looses focus the field will be validated.
The frame work makes in easy for a fx controller of a form to control the form validation process. 

## Java-FX concurrency
My business layer is behind a service layer with a number of Spring services. Some of these services provide batch functionality. Such a batch function only take a few seconds at most, so no need for progress bars. However at the begin of a batch process I want to display a 'batch started message' and at the end a message of either 'successful' or 'error'. When I try to run the batch process in the FX-application thread than the start message is never shown. When I use Java-FX concurrency to asynchronously run the batch process in another thread then the start message is displayed. I use the Spring `TaskExecutor` to provide the threads for the asynchronous `javafx.concurrent.Task`. 

## A PDF-viewer
My application needs a way to show multi page PDF's. To my surprise there is no JavaFX framework for that. It is suggested to use pdf.js of Firefox in the webclient. That worked in my IDE, but from within a jar the whole JVM crashes without any notion why. Also pdf.js is extremely slow.  Apache PDFBox `PDFRenderer` is capable of rendering a `java.awt.image.BufferedImage` per PDF-page.
With `SwingFXUtils.toFXImage(bufferedImage, null)` I convert it to a `javafx.scene.image.Image`. That image is then used in a simple PDFViewer that I wrote. This approach delivers fine looking PDF's with an excellent performance.

## Printing
JavaFx has a way of printing Nodes. I've tried it for the PDF's and the result was very, very poor. I then switched to AWT printing and that works excellently, but requires the application to run with headless=false. By default SpringBoot runs with headless=true. I had to change that in the `SpringApplicationBuilder` when building the ApplicationContext.

## Business Layer
For me the business layer is not very special. It uses techniques that a backend Java developer is familiar with. But still it has points that were fun building:
- Generating a Direct Debit file for the bank for the yearly membership fee; (partly reusing older code)
- Playing with Excel in a structured way; (partly reusing older code)
- Matching payments in a bank statement with a specific member. With the more restrictive AVG privacy regulations it is harder than before because the address of the person that made the payment is no longer supplied. 
- Generating PDF-documents based on templates. 
- Generating simple MS Word documents.

## Unit testing Java-FX
Java-fx requires the launch of the toolset and a special FX-application thread to run its functionality. That can easily conflict with the way the maven-surefire-plugin uses forking for its tests. 
Initially I had serious performance problems running my Java-FX unit tests. Then I set the forkCount of the maven-sure-fire plugin to 1 and I load the Java-FX toolset only once for all my tests. My tests run asynchronously in a `Platform.runLater(runnable)`.
I use `Awaitility` so the thread of the maven-surefire-plugin will wait for the Java-FX runnable to finish. Well what can I say? It works and has a good performance. I have also looked at TestFX , but I haven't used it because I think it doesn't add much to my unit tests. I'm not interested in testing the user interactions. I'm interested in the interaction between the fxml and its controller. 

# What about Java modularity?
The classpath of application consists of about 100 jars. Some are modules, some have a `Automatic-Module-Name` in their manifest and some are just pre JPMS jars. (This was the situation when I started this project in 2020.)
I've tried putting a `module-info.java` in every Maven module of the project. The result was a lot of errors. For example back then HikariCP version 3.4.5 refers to the non existing module `hibernate.core`; (I know this is fixed in HikariCP version 4.0.3.)
Also there are java packages that exist in multiple jars. Specially the messy jar structure of `org.apache.xmlgraphics:fop` causes challenges. (I have been using Apache Fop for 20 years and it's dependency structure has always been a mess.)

In the end I managed to get my modules error free and I got the application running fully functional in my IDE. However I was unable to run the `@SpringBootTest` annotated unit tests. This was because the SpringBoot component scan was incomplete and I was unable to fix it. (version 2.x of SpringBoot.)

My modular application was still relying on several non modular jars. This means that I still was unable to run JLINK without tricks. So I reverted Java modularity, but preserving the cleaned classpath.

# Deployment
My goal is to run my application with a minimal JRE. Via trail and error I was able to determine the jmods needed in this minimal JRE. I added the required JavaFX modules to it. (I first had JavaFx in the application jar, but in Java 17 this gives a warning. By adding the JavaFx modules to the minimal JRE, the warning is avoided.) 

I want to package my application in a single jar which includes all dependencies.
There are several strategies to construct such a jar:
- Via the maven-assembly-plugin (jar-with-dependencies)
- Via the spring-boot-maven-plugin (repackage)
- Via the maven-shade-plugin

I've tried all three. 
The maven-assembly-plugin fails to build an executable jar, because (at least) the `spring.factories` resource is incorrect.
The spring-boot-maven-plugin builds an executable jar, but with considerable overhead which makes the jar relatively large and slow compared to the jar generated by the maven-shade-plugin. Furthermore the BOOT-INF structure makes it harder to load resource. Especially org.apache.xmlgraphics:fop had troubles with it.
So the maven-shade-plugin is my choice for building the executable jar. 
Starting the application, with the jar built by the maven-shade-plugin, takes 3 seconds. (Quite good compared to the initial 9 seconds.)

So now I have a minimal JRE and an executable application jar. How to ship this? (Windows is the target platform for my Java-FX application.)
I've installed WIX-tools on my PC and tried JPACKAGE. It generates an exe which is able to install my application in the Program Files.
However I want to be able to configure the location of the embedded database before the first start of the application. I'm unable to get that done via JPACKAGE. (I'm sure it is feasible, but I could not find out how.)

The alternative is to produce a zip-file. That is what I've done via the maven-assembly-plugin. 

I want to start my application as an EXE. I used Launch4J to create such a single instance EXE without wrapping the jar and with a relative path to the minimal JRE.

This assembled ZIP will contain:
- the application jar 
- the minimal JRE
- The EXE created via Launch4J
- `db.properties` file with the configurable database location

# What about a Quarkus?

With Quarkus it is relatively easy to build a native image of a Java application. Quarkus claims to be much faster than SpringBoot. I seriously tried Quarkus, but rejected it.

The first point is that Quarkus beans are managed components whereas SpringBoot components are POJO's. In combination with FXML I had strange behaviour with Quarkus managed beans, caused by the hidden subclasses that Quarkus generates. I have not found any problems with the SpringBoot POJO's.

The second point is about the database. There is no Java database system (yet) that can be used in a native image; neither H2 nor Derby can be used. You can use Sqlite but that turned out to be so slow that the native image had a slower startup than the SpringBoot version. Conclusion: I stick to SpringBoot.

# Conclusion

I now know quite a lot about building a complex JavaFX application. I was a steep learning curve. I refactored the application quite a lot until I was satisfied about its architecture. It took me hundreds of hours to build it. 
I could still learn a lot about the fx:css; it seems to have some nasty limits. However this was not my goal. 
My conclusion is: 
**YES** you can build well structured, well maintainable, well performing desktop applications with JavaFX without needing 
tricky constructs. (Although I used some tricks to run the unit tests efficiently.)  
I now happily use the application on a daily basis!
